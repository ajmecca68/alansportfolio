# Alan Mecca's Portfolio Webpage

## Description

This is my first attempt at a personal website describing my skillset as a full stack programmer.

* I wanted to create a site that showcased my skills in a concise and clear manner.
* Through trial and error (starting completely over at one point) I was able to better focus my skillset.
